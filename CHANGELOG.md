## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backwards compatible bug fixes

### Version Format

Versions follow the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]`

Examples:
- `1.0.0` - First stable release
- `1.1.0` - Minor feature addition
- `1.1.1` - Bug fix release
- `2.0.0-alpha.1` - Pre-release version
- `2.0.0-beta.2+20241220` - Pre-release with build metadata

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions use the following suffixes:
- `alpha` - Early development, API may change significantly
- `beta` - Feature complete, API stabilizing, testing phase
- `rc` - Release candidate, final testing before stable release

### Release Branches

- `main` - Current development branch
- `release/v1.x` - Maintenance branch for v1.x releases
- `release/v2.x` - Maintenance branch for v2.x releases

### Compatibility Promise

#### API Compatibility
- **Patch releases** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): No breaking changes
- **Minor releases** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): Backwards compatible additions
- **Major releases** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): May include breaking changes

#### Configuration Compatibility
- Configuration files remain compatible within major versions
- Deprecated configuration options are supported for one major version
- Migration guides provided for breaking configuration changes

#### Database Schema Compatibility
- Database migrations provided for all schema changes
- Automatic migration support within minor versions
- Manual migration steps documented for major versions

### Breaking Change Policy

Breaking changes are introduced only in major releases and include:

1. **API Changes**
   - Removing public methods, properties, or classes
   - Changing method signatures
   - Modifying return types or exceptions

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Removing configuration options
   - Changing configuration structure
   - Modifying default behavior

3. **Dependency Changes**
   - Updating minimum .NET version requirements
   - Removing support for databases or platforms
   - Major dependency updates with breaking changes

### Deprecation Policy

1. **Announcement**: Deprecated features are announced in release notes
2. **Timeline**: Deprecated features remain supported for one major version
3. **Documentation**: Deprecation warnings added to documentation
4. **Alternatives**: Replacement functionality provided before deprecation

### Security Updates

Security updates follow a separate timeline:

- **High severity**: Patch within 1 week
- **Medium/Low severity**: Included in next scheduled release

Security patches are backported to:
- Current major version
- Previous major version (for 6 months after new major release)

### Support Policy

- **Current major version**: Full support (features, bug fixes, security)
- **Previous major version**: Security updates only (6 months)
- **Older versions**: No official support (community support available)

### Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes and security updates
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly (every 3 months)
- **Major releases**: Yearly or when significant breaking changes are needed

### Release Process
