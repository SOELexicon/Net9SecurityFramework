## 🏗️ Framework Overview

The SecurityFramework is built with these core principles:

- **🚀 Performance First**: Sub-millisecond IP assessment with in-memory storage
- **🔧 Modular Design**: Optional features can be completely disabled
- **🔄 Real-time Optional**: SignalR/WebSocket features are entirely configurable
- **🛡️ Defensive Focus**: Built specifically for defensive security applications
- **📊 Data-Driven**: JSON pattern templates for flexible threat detection

## 🎯 Key Features

### Core Security
- **IP Intelligence**: Historical tracking, behavioral profiling, trust building
- **Threat Detection**: Pattern-based detection with OWASP Top 10 coverage
- **Parameter Jacking Prevention**: IDOR detection and blocking
- **Adaptive Responses**: Graduated response system (allow/challenge/restrict/block)

### Data & Persistence
- **Hybrid Storage**: In-memory performance with SQLite persistence
- **EF Core Integration**: Full Entity Framework Core support
- **Data Annotations**: Comprehensive validation and security attributes
- **Configurable Retention**: Flexible data retention and archival policies

### Integration & Monitoring
- **ASP.NET Core Middleware**: Seamless pipeline integration
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Optional live security monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring and diagnostics
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails and security logs

## 📖 Documentation Standards

This documentation follows these conventions:

- **Code Examples**: All examples are production-ready and tested
